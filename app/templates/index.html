  <h2>What is Connected Component Labelling?</h2>
  <p>
    Shapiro et al.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling#cite_note-:1-7">[7]</a> define CCL as an operator whose “input is a binary image and [...] output is a symbolic image in 
    which the label assigned to each pixel is an integer uniquely identifying the connected component to which that pixel belongs.”
  </p>
  <h2>Algorithm used in the project: </h2>
  <p>
    The two-pass algorithm,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling#cite_note-Shapiro2002-13">[13]</a> (also known as the Hoshen–Kopelman algorithm) iterates through 2-dimensional binary data. 
    The algorithm makes two passes over the image: the first pass to assign temporary labels and record equivalences, and 
    the second pass to replace each temporary label by the smallest label of its equivalence class. 
  </p>

  Sample graphical output from running the two-pass algorithm on a binary image. 
  The first image is unprocessed, while the last one has been recolored with label information. 
  Darker hues indicate the neighbors of the pixel being processed.
